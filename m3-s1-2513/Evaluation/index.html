      <h1>Client & Server</h1>

      <h3>What is Client ?</h3>
      <p>
        the hardware or software (like a web browser) that requests resources or services from a server.
        The Client interface represents an executable context such as a Worker, or a SharedWorker. Window clients are represented by the more-specific WindowClient. You can get Client/WindowClient objects from methods such as Clients.matchAll() and Clients.get().
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>What is Server ?</h3>
      <p>
        A server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client. A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center. A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to client programs or a user interface to human clients.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>How Client and Server communicate ?</h3>
      <p>
        Client and server communication typically follows a request-response pattern, where the client initiates a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or service, using protocols like HTTP, WebSockets, or gRPC.

      <h3>Journey of a Web Request</h3>
      <h4>from browser to server</h4>
      <p>
        DNS Lookup: The very first step is for the browser to understand the address you’ve given it. The Domain Name System (DNS) acts as the internet’s phone book. It translates human-friendly web addresses (like www.example.com) into computer-friendly IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1). This is crucial because, in the vast network of the internet, resources are located by their IP addresses.
        IP Routing: With the IP address resolved, your request is now ready to travel. But it doesn’t go straight to the destination. Instead, it hops across multiple routers, each time getting closer to the target server. This journey is guided by Internet Protocol (IP) routing, where each router makes a decision on how to forward the request based on the destination IP.
        Edge Caching: Before your request reaches its final destination, it might hit an edge server. Edge caching is a technique where frequently requested content is stored on servers that are geographically closer to the user. This can significantly reduce load times and bandwidth usage. If the requested data is available in the cache, it’s returned to the user immediately, without ever reaching the target server.
